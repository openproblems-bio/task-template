  ## Installation

  You need to have Docker, Java, and Viash installed. Follow
  [these instructions](https://openproblems.bio/documentation/fundamentals/requirements)
  to install the required dependencies.

  ## Add a method

  To add a method to the repository, follow the instructions in the `scripts/add_a_method.sh` script.

  ## Frequently used commands
  
  To get started, you can run the following commands:

  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:openproblems-bio/<task-name>.git

  cd <task-name>
  
  # download resources
  scripts/download_resources.sh
  ```

  To run the benchmark, you first need to build the components. Afterwards, you can run the benchmark:
  
  ```bash
  viash ns build --parallel --setup cachedbuild

  scripts/run_benchmark.sh
  ```

  After adding a component, it is recommended to run the tests to ensure that the component is working correctly:

  ```bash
  viash ns test --parallel
  ```
  
  Optionally, you can provide the `--query` argument to test only a subset of components:

  ```bash
  viash ns test --parallel --query "component_name"
  ```
